Gender Classification Using Neural Networks

This project demonstrates the implementation of a fully connected neural network to classify gender based on facial images. 
Using the UTKFace dataset, which comprises over 20,000 aligned and cropped face images representing a diverse range of ages (from 0 to 116 years) and ethnic backgrounds, this project aims to build and test a simple yet effective neural network for accurate gender classification.
